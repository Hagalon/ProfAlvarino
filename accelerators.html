      <h2>Linear Accelerators</h2>
      <p>A
        <strong>linear accelerator (LINAC)</strong>
        is a type of particle accelerator that accelerates charged
      particles along a straight path using alternating electric fields. The particles gain energy as they travel
      through a series of cylindrical electrodes of increasing length.</p>
      <p><strong>Key features:</strong>
        Straight-line acceleration, can accelerate both electrons and protons, used in
      radiation therapy and research.</p>

      <h2>Betatron</h2>
      <p>A
        <strong>betatron</strong>
        is a circular accelerator that uses electromagnetic induction to accelerate electrons in a circular path. It works by increasing the magnetic field strength as the electrons gain energy, keeping them in a constant orbit.</p>
      <p><strong>Key features:</strong>
        Circular design, accelerates only electrons, uses changing magnetic field for
      acceleration, historically important for high-energy physics.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="plain">
      <h2>Cyclotron</h2>
      <p>A
        <strong>cyclotron</strong>
        is a circular accelerator that uses a constant magnetic field and alternating
      electric fields to accelerate charged particles in a spiral path. Particles gain energy each time they cross the
      gap between two "D-shaped" electrodes.</p>
      <p><strong>Key features:</strong>
        Spiral acceleration path, constant magnetic field, used for proton therapy and
      isotope production, compact design compared to synchrotrons.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="plain">
      <h2>Synchrotron</h2>
      <p>A
        <strong>synchrotron</strong>
        is a circular particle accelerator that uses synchronized electric and magnetic
      fields to accelerate charged particles to extremely high energies. Unlike a cyclotron, it can accelerate particles to near-light speeds by adjusting both fields as particles gain energy.</p>
      <p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Particles are first pre-accelerated in a LINAC or cyclotron</li>
        <li>They are then injected into a circular vacuum tube (storage ring)</li>
        <li>Precise magnetic fields bend the particle beam around the ring</li>
        <li>Radiofrequency cavities provide accelerating electric fields</li>
        <li>As particles gain energy, magnetic field strength increases to maintain their orbit</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Key features:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Can accelerate particles to much higher energies than cyclotrons</li>
        <li>Produces intense synchrotron radiation (used in research)</li>
        <li>Used in particle physics (e.g., Large Hadron Collider) and materials science</li>
        <li>Requires precise synchronization of electric and magnetic fields</li>
        <li>Large-scale facilities (often hundreds of meters in diameter)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Applications:</strong>
        Particle physics research, materials analysis, medical imaging, drug development, and nanotechnology.</p>
